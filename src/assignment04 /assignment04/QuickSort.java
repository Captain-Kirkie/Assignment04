/* This is just the basic algorithm using an integer array. I wanted to make sure it worked before I made it generic,
 * and it does. It seems like every website on the Internet has you start with both iterators on the left side instead
 * of the way Varun explained with one pointer starting at the beginning and another starting at the end going backward.
 * I was really stuck on trying to do it the way Varun explained which I was eventually able to figure out by looking
 * at his slides. I always pick the last value of the array to be the pivot which turns out to be a pretty good idea
 * because it is always random and easy to implement. */
